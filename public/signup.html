                "It was 1956 when I had found the special gene that began to mutate human DNA to an advanced being. I
                named these beings 'Homo sapiens homovorus' and became the first one.
                The only problem was a need for increased blood to help accelerate muscle creation and fast healing.
                This is why I created Rine Heart Monitoring to engineer new devices
                that will help Homo Sapiens Homovorus survive and eventually take over this world. " -Dr. Rusty Rinehart,
                PHD, MD, DO, JD, DSW.
