    <p class = "blockquote text-right col border-secondary" id="info"> Rusty has been fascinated by how computers work his whole life growing up in San Diego. 
        In 2019, he arrived at the University of Arizona to uncover the mystery with an ECE major. 
        Rusty brought students together during the pandemic when he co-created the ECE Discord with Chris Bremser. 
        With one year left until graduation in 2023, Rusty has been very successful academically, and also got a taste of the corporate world while he interned for Intel in 2022. 
        After graduation, Rusty dreams of making a living designing CPUs. Contact: rustyrinehart@arizona.edu</p>

            After tearing apart a computer (and breaking it), Ary Nath got into how computers work and eventually desiring to learn how they tick in detail. 
            At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Ary Nath came swinging into the ECE program as a Stamps Scholar. 
            Ary has been at the top of the game academically, nailing Dean's List with Distinction in the course of a year. 
            After graduation in 2023, Ary plans to work in chip design at a major semiconductor company. Contact: anath@arizona.edu
