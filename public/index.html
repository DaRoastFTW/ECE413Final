    <p class = "blockquote text-right col border-secondary" id="info"> Rusty has been fascinated by how computers work his whole life growing up in San Diego. 
        In 2019, he arrived at the University of Arizona to uncover the mystery with an ECE major. 
        Rusty brought students together during the pandemic when he co-created the ECE Discord with Chris Bremser. 
        With one year left until graduation in 2023, Rusty has been very successful academically, and also got a taste of the corporate world while he interned for Intel in 2022. 
        After graduation, Rusty dreams of making a living designing CPUs. Contact: rustyrinehart@arizona.edu</p>

            After tearing apart a computer (and breaking it), Ary Nath got into how computers work and eventually desiring to learn how they tick in detail. 
            At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Ary Nath came swinging into the ECE program as a Stamps Scholar. 
            Ary has been at the top of the game academically, nailing Dean's List with Distinction in the course of a year. 
            After graduation in 2023, Ary plans to work in chip design at a major semiconductor company. Contact: anath@arizona.edu

        <img src="images/Portal2_cave_johnson_and_caroline.png" alt = "Cave Jonhson, CEO Aperture Science" class=" rounded-circle float-left col mw-25 img-fluid" >
        <p class="blockquote text-right col border-secondary" id="info">
            In 1943, Cave Johnson created Aperture Fixtures, a shower curtain manufacturer. The precursor to Aperture Science, he selected the name because it 'makes the curtains sound more hygienic'. 
            He became a billionaire after winning contracts to manufacture shower curtains for all branches of the U.S. Military except the Navy, winning the '1943 shower curtain salesman of the year' award.
            At the time of its creation, Aperture Science Innovations had developed the Aperture Science Portable Quantum Tunneling Device, 
            a prototype to the modern Handheld Portal Device Chell wields. As such, it seems that Aperture had already started to perfect portal technology,
            but was not ready to release it to the world, under the belief that much more could be done than just create portals. 
            Of course, the technology was also impractical and bulky, and was delayed by Cave's wild innovations. During the 1970s, Aperture Science had become known as just 'Aperture', and the rise of Black Mesa and its success in bidding for contracts pushed Cave's temper to the limit. 
            It is also implied that Black Mesa stole designs from Aperture and began to produce them commercially before Aperture could do so because Johnson refused to release the devices until they met his eccentric standard of perfection. 
            It was around this time that Caroline became a bigger part of Cave's life as a secretary, and Cave became more desperate in his struggle to continue his work by offering $60 to potential test subjects, although only rarely were test subjects able to collect their reward due to the hazards involved.

            Dr Salehi, this entire website is a joke website. I, Chris, hope that this is obvious. 
            So everything written on any of these is meant to be taken as a joke. The content of the HTML may be a joke, however we have taken the project seriously. 
            We have implemented everything on the rubric. No matter the differences between you and I, we as a group have enjoyed this class. We also recognise the difficulties 
            thrust onto you by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. 

            Thank you Sir. <span class="float-right m-3"> -Ary, Chris, Rusty!</span>
