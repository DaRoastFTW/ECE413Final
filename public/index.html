    In 2019, he arrived at the University of Arizona to uncover the mystery with an ECE major. 
    Rusty brought students together during the pandemic when he co-created the ECE Discord with Chris Bremser. 
    With one year left until graduation in 2023, Rusty has been very successful academically, and also got a taste of the corporate world while he interned for Intel in 2022.

        After tearing apart a computer (and breaking it), Ary Nath got into how computers work and eventually desiring to learn how they tick in detail. 
        At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Ary Nath came swinging into the ECE program as a Stamps Scholar. 
        Ary has been at the top of the game academically, nailing Dean's List with Distinction in the course of a year. 
        After graduation in 2023, Ary plans to work in chip design at a major semiconductor company. Contact: anath@arizona.edu
